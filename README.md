# graphing-prototypes

This repo contains 5 demos of different graphing technologies. To view each
demo, `cd` into the directory, install the dependencies, and serve the files
up from the filesystem.

```
$ cd d3
$ bower install
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

Then go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser. If you want to see all the
demos side by side, you can run `SimpleHTTPServer` on multiple different ports.
